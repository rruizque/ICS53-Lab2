shell.c is the program WITHOUT a command-line parser. It only reads
the first string of input after "prompt> "  

tcshell.c is the program WITH a command-line parser. It can read any
number of arguments after "prompt> " separated by a space. Otherwise, it's identical to shell.c ... NOTE: THIS PROGRAM TAKES CODE FROM THE ICS53
TEXTBOOK. DON'T TURN IN THIS CODE.
